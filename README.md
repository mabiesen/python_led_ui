# python_led_ui
Project to use python as a user interface for creating cool 32x32 LED Matrix displays

UI portion of the project is functional at this time in Python3.  To use:
1. download the zip of this Project
2. extract to an isolated folder
3. Run the file titled create.py

The LED matrix display portion of the project has been created in Python 2.7.  Adafruit's library has not yet adapted to Python 3.


My solutions to this dilemma currently is to recreate the UI in Python 2.7, which shouldn't require too many changes. Once completed, I will create and option for a live display environment.
